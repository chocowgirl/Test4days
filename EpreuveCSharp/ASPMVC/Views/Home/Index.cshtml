    <h1 class="display-4">Hello!  Welcome to a slow-coder's version of hell.</h1>
    <p>One thing is for sure, I spent waaaay too long on my back-end (DB and SPs as well as the DAL).</p>
    <p>I started to skip certain things in the BLL just so that I could even make it to the MVC layer, but as you can see... there's not much of what I did in the lower layers that's gotten to the surface (user interface) yet!</p>
        <p>>>>If you want to see what DID get to the surface of this application:</p>
    <br />
    <p> Add "/user/create" to the address bar to sign up.  It works!  You can even edit your pseudonym/handle, isn't that nifty?</p>
    <br />
    <p> If you want to see the games, instead of "/user/create", put "/jeu" at the end of the original address.  You can't even ADD a game yet, but you CAN see the details of the games in the list if you like.'</p>
